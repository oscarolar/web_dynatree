Acknowledged room for improvements
----------------------------------

- allow several dynatree fields in one page (stop hardcoding dynatreee
   div id for that in render(), base it on some field id).

- general styling

- make display properties somewhat configurable : with/without icons

- introduce options for the bootsrap of the tree structure
  (with/without a mother category etc)

- dynatree form fields !
