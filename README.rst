Integration of jquery.dynatree into OpenERP web
===============================================

This addon defines a new search field based on `jquery.dynatree
<http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/index.html>_` for arborescent
structures such as product and partner categories.

To use it, simply add ``widget="dynatree_selection"`` in the wished
``field`` of your search view.

See the included ``sample_dynatree_view.xml`` for an example with POS
categories in the products search page.

This project is at an early stage, feel free to contribute, and keep
posted ! See the included ``TODO.txt`` to see what's in the pipe.
