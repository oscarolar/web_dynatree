Integration of jquery.dynatree into OpenERP web
===============================================

This addon defines a new search field based on `jquery.dynatree
<http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/index.html>`_ for arborescent
structures such as product and partner categories.

This project is at an early stage, feel free to contribute, and keep
posted ! See the included ``TODO.txt`` to see what's in the pipe.
